# q-eegnet
This repository contains the development of Q-EEGNet from training to quantization and finally to the implementation on Mr. Wolf.

This project was developed by Tibor Schneider during his Semester thesis at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Xiaying Wang, Michael Hersche, and Lukas Cavigelli.

For more details, please read the paper *Q-EEGNet: an Energy-Efficient 8-bit Quantized Parallel EEGNet Implementation for Edge Motor-Imagery Brain--Machine Interfaces* available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9239647) and on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11690).
